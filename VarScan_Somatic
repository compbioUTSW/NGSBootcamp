# Single Neucleotide Variants (SNVs) and small Insertion and Deletion (Indel) analysis

# Very general workflow for variant analysis
# 1. fastq files from your sample
# 2. Run FastQC for quality control
#  2a) if qualtify of bases (in particular at the end of reads) are bad, perform trimming.
#  2b) if there are adapter sequences present in your fastq files, remove adapter sequence.
# => OK. fastq quality is good. Lets go to step 3
# 3. Perform Alignemnt using your favorite aligner (e.g., BWA, etc.) and generate SAM or BAM files.
# 4. Sort bam file and generate an index file for your bam file.
# 5. Variant calling using VarScan (http://dkoboldt.github.io/varscan/)
#  5a) Generate mpileup data.
#    => What is (m)pileup data? Go to the following link: http://samtools.sourceforge.net/pileup.shtml

varscan=/home/thwang/software/VarScan.v2.3.9.jar #VarScan is software to call somatic mutation

#generate mpileup using samtools. Runing time ~ 5min for each sample
$samtools mpileup -f $reference $Nbam > normal.mpileup
$samtools mpileup -f $reference $Tbam > tumor.mpileup

#calling somatic mutations using varscan, the output would be somatic.snp.vcf and somatic.indel.vcf. Runing time ~ 5min
$java -jar $varscan somatic normal.mpileup tumor.mpileup somatic --output-vcf

#annotate vcf file using snpEFF. Runing time ~ 2min
$java -jar $snpEFF hg19 somatic.indel.vcf > somatic.indel.ann.vcf
$java -jar $snpEFF hg19 somatic.snp.vcf > somatic.snp.ann.vcf
### when testing in the account of thwang, the time was right, but when I was using my account, the time would be very long....(more than 10min for steps which suppose to use 5min)â€‹
